# 📌 Project Overview

- This HR Employee Attrition & Headcount Analytics Project is Built on 1,470 employee records, this project combines Power Query–based data transformation, calculated fields, and pivot-driven analytics to move beyond static HR reporting. The dashboard enables HR leaders to explore how department, education level, gender, business travel, tenure, overtime, and career progression interact to influence employee exits.
Rather than asking “How many employees left?”, this project focuses on:
Who is leaving, from where, under what conditions, and why?

# 🏢 Corporate Workforce Problems Solved
##  1️⃣ Burnout Masked as Productivity (Overtime Risk)
### Problem:
- Overtime is often normalized as commitment, masking early burnout signals.
### What This Project Reveals:
- Attrition among overtime employees is significantly higher, confirming overtime as a predictive attrition driver, not a productivity advantage.

## 2️⃣ Role & Department-Level Attrition Blind Spots
### Problem:
- Aggregate attrition numbers hide where talent loss is actually concentrated.
### What This Project Solves:
- By breaking attrition down by department and job role, HR can identify:
Sales as a high-risk function
Specific job roles acting as churn epicenters. 

## 3️⃣ Career Stagnation & Promotion Delays
### Problem:
- Employees often leave not because of pay, but because of stalled growth.
### What This Project Reveals:
- Attrition trends increase with years since last promotion, highlighting promotion velocity as a key retention lever.

## 4️⃣ Attrition Numbers Without Context Lead to Wrong Decisions
### Problem:
- Treating all exits as equal often leads to reactive decisions such as blanket hiring or misallocated HR budgets—because leadership lacks context on who is leaving and why.
### What This Project Solves:
- This dashboard adds context to attrition by analyzing exits across department, gender,job role and linking them with overtime, promotion gaps, tenure, and engagement drivers.

# 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out
- Focuses on diagnostic HR analytics, not surface reporting
- Combines behavioral, demographic, and structural drivers
- Uses Power Query + Pivot logic, not manual analysis
- Designed for HR leaders, not just analysts
Links people decisions to business continuity and cost.
